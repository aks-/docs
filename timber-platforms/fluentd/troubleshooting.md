# FluentD Troubleshooting

The [Timber Fluentd output plugin](https://github.com/timberio/fluent-plugin-timber) extends the [`Fluent::BufferedOutput`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/fluent/fluentd/Fluent/BufferedOutput) class, which provides basic logging functionality. The best way to debug Timber in the Fluentd context is to check the Fluentd logs. Please refer to the [Fluentd Troubleshooting guide](https://docs.fluentd.org/v0.12/articles/trouble-shooting).
