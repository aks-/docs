Timber integegrates with [Now (Zeit)](https://zeit.co/now) through the [Timber for Node library](/languages/node), forwarding your node logs to the Timber service. Along the way, Timber captures context and metadata so you can quickly search your logs by version, host, HTTP metadata, and more! It's complete insight into your Zeit applications.

Installation of Timber on [Now (Zeit)](https://zeit.co/now) uses the Timber Node library. Please follow the [Timber Node library HTTP installation instructions](/languages/node/installation/http).
