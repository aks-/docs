# Docker

As Docker and containers continue to change and evolve, so too do their logging strategies and best practices.
Consequenty, Timber offers multiple Docker log collection solutions to support a wide range of deployments.

We recommend using our [Docker logging driver](docker-logging-driver) as it is simple to configure and integrates with the already running
Docker daemon.

_More options coming soon!_
