# Team Members & Access

Timber makes it easy to add multiple users and manage their access. **There is no limit to the number of users you can add to your account.** This avoids account sharing and the inconveniences associated with that.


## Roles & Permissions

Team members fall under 2 roles: `admin` and `member`. What each can do is show below:

Action | Member | Admin

Create apps | X | ✓
Edit apps | X | ✓
Delete apps | X | ✓
Access apps | ✓ | ✓
Access the console | ✓ | ✓
Delete the organization | X | ✓
Access billing | X | ✓
Create members | X | ✓
Edit members | X | ✓
Delete members | X | ✓
