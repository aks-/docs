title: Obtaining Your API Key
---
*Don't have an API key? You can obtain one by registering at [https://app.timber.io](https://app.timber.io). Your API key will be display after you create your first application within Timber.*

---

With Timber, each application you setup has it's own unique API key. This allows you to effectively control ingestion on a per application basis instead of sharing API keys across multiple sources. Obtaining your API is simple:


## Steps

1. In the top nav click `Apps`.
2. For the desired application, click the cog / settings icon on the far right.
3. Click the `Installation` tab.
4. Your API key will be presented at the top of the page.
