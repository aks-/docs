# Inspect HTTP Requests

*â“˜ This feature requires the use of [one of our libraries](/languages).*

Inspecting HTTP requests is a powerful feature that allows you to view *all* attributes of the incoming request, including the parameters sent. This is valuable information to have during debugging. It helps you to reproduce issues enabling faster resolutio.


## Steps

1. Locate the request you'd like to inspect by clicking on the prefixed request ID tag.
2. Locate the controller call event.
3. Click the "eye" icon to view that logs context.
4. Notice the `params_json` field in the panel.
