Timber allows you to quick seek to any specific time:


## Steps

1. Click the `Seek to date` button in the top right
2. Type the date in [natural language or any date format](#natural-language-dates-/-times).


## Natural Language Dates / Times

You can supply dates / times in natural language:

1. `today at 3m`
2. `last wednesday at 4:01pm` (last meaning, last week)
3. `wednesday at 4:01pm` (the most recent wednesday, past or future)
4. `1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00`
5. [Complete reference â†’](https://sugarjs.com/docs/#/DateParsing)


## Linking

After seeking to a date the URL will update with a `date=` parameter. Simply copy
that URL, anyone navigating to the URL will jump to the same time. Ex:

    https://app.timber.io/organizations/timber/apps/my-app-production/console?date=Mon+Mar+13+2017+14%3A00%3A00+GMT-0500+%28CDT%29
