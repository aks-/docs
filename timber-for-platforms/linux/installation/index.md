We support Linux-based systems through our [cross-platform agent](/docs/platforms/other/agent). For most Linux distributions, you can use our [General Linux](/docs/platforms/linux/installation/systemd-linux) installation instructions.

We have specific instructions for [Amazon Linux](/docs/platforms/linux/installation/amazon-linux) since it requires some different scripts than other major distributions.
