It is rare that Heroku or Timber will encounter actual errors with log delivery. Delivery issues with Heroku is almost always related to an invalid API key. As such, we recommend double checking your API key as a first step. If you aren't sure how to obtain your API key, please refer to the [support doc](/timber-app/applications/obtaining-api-key).
