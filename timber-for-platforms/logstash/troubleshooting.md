The [Timber Logstash output plugin](https://github.com/timberio/logstash-output-timber) extends the [LogStash::Outputs::Base class](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/logstash-core/1.5.2.2/LogStash/Outputs/Base) which provides basic logging functionality. The best way to debug Timber is to checkout the Logstash logs. Please refer to the [Logstash logging / debugging guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/logging.html).
