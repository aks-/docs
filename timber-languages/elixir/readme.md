Timber can integrate directly with your [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) application through it's [Elixir library](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir). It makes your logs easier search, use, and _read_ by transparently capturing [context and metadata](/concepts/metadata-context-and-events) [_without_ modifying your log messages](/concepts/structuring-through-augmentation). It's a silent upgrade, making it a no-risk addition to your Elixir app. It's a logging platform and library working in harmony to produce great logs that make you more productive.
