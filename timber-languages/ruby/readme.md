Timber for Ruby is a drop in replacement for your Ruby logger that
[unobtrusively augments](https://timber.io/concepts/structuring-through-augmentation) your
logs with [rich metadata and context](https://timber.io/concepts/metadata-context-and-events)
making them [easier to search, use, and read](#get-things-done-with-your-logs). It pairs with the
[Timber console](#the-timber-console) to deliver a tailored Ruby logging experience designed to make
you more productive.
