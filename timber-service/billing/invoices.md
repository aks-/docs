# Invoices

Timber automatically creates invoices, making it easy to share them with the relevant department. You can access invoices by going to your `Settings`, and clicking on the `Invoices` tab. 

Invoices are automatically sent to the email detailed under `Settings` and `Plan & Payment`. 

Only organization administrators are able to access billing information.
