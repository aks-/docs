[The Timber Agent](https://github.com/timberio/agent) is a highly efficient binary utility (written in Go) for transporting raw logs (STDIN and files) from your server infrastructure to the Timber hosted service. It implements batching, checkpointing, and retry logic to ensure efficient and reliable delivery of your log data. Its small size and low memory footprint make it a reliable addition to your infrastructure.
