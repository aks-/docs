[Timber for Node](https://github.com/timberio/timber-node) is a drop-in upgrade for your Node logs that works with the `console` and [other popular loggers](integrations) to [transparently augment](/concepts/structuring-through-augmentation) your logs with critical [metadata and context](/concepts/metadata-context-and-events); turning them into rich, useful events. It pairs with the
[Timber console](#the-timber-console) to deliver a tailored Node logging experience designed to make
you more productive.

[Start here. Hook into the `console` with one line.](installation)
