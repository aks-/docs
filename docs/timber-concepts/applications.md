description: What is an application in Timber and what does it represent?
---
Instead of providing a single mega log stream, Timber is organized by the familiar [organizations](/concepts/organizations) and applications structure. This is used by many popular services, such as Github and Heroku. Each application belongs to an organization, and organizations control it's members and access. Applications, specifically, represent a group of logs making it easy to organize your logs in ways that make the most sense for your organizations. They can represent a Rails app, a Postgresql database, a web server, or any "application" that generates logs.
