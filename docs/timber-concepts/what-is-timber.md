Timber is a cloud-based logging platform that aggregates and centrlaizes logs across various sources, making it easy to access and use your logs. Timber differs from your traditional logging platform in that we provide [application level libraries](/languages) and a [defined log schema](/concepts/log-event-json-schema) that work in concert with the [Timber application](/guides/app) to provide a tailored, high-quality logging experience with minimal effort. To further understand what Timber is, we recommend these articles:
