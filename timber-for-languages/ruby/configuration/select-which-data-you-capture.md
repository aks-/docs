The [Timber for Ruby library](https://github.com/timberio/timber-ruby) automatically captures structured data through it's [integrations](/docs/languages/ruby/integrations). It you aren't familiar with Timber's concept of [metadata, context, and events](/docs/concepts/metadata-context-and-events), please check out that document. In some cases, it might be preferable to disable select integrations to save on cost. To get started, please see [each integration's documentation page](/docs/languages/ruby/integrations) for specific instructions on disabling that integration.
