Timber is a cloud-based logging system built for developers. It integrates directly with your application using the libraries listed below. This allows Timber to capture [context and metadata](/timber-concepts/metadata-context-and-events) without having to modify your logs and make them an unreadable mess. This makes your logs easy to search, use, and _read_, giving you unparalleled insight into your app. In addition, each Timber library integrates with popular frameworks and libraries applying this same benefit to your existing logs. To get started, choose your language below:

1. [**Elixir**](elixir)
2. [**Node**](node)
3. [**Ruby**](ruby)
4. [**Other**](other)
