The [Timber for Elixir library](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir) automatically captures structured data through it's [integrations](/timber-for-languages/elixir/integrations). It you aren't familiar with Timber's concept of [metadata, context, and events](/timber-concepts/metadata-context-and-events), please check out that document. In some cases, it might be preferable to disable select integrations to save on cost. Because of Elixir's explicit nature, please see [each integration's documentation page](/timber-for-languages/elixir/integrations) for specific instructions on disabling that integration.
