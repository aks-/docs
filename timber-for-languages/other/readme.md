Didn't see your language listed? Not to worry! The Timber libraries are *optional* upgrades, and while they improve the overall experience, they are *not* required to use Timber. Timber was designed to offer a really great traditional logging experience at its core. For example, Timber offers [intelligent parsing](/timber-service/log-formats-parsing), a [schema](/timber-concepts/the-timber-log-event-schema) you can conform to, and [blazing fast powerful search](/timber-app/console-log-viewer/searching). To send your logs to Timber we recommend one of the following approaches:

1. [**Send logs directly from your platform**](/timber-for-platforms)
2. [**Send logs over HTTP (Timber API)**](send-logs-over-http)
